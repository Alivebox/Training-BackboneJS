In this repository I include a bunch of backbonejs web applications from simplest to more complex ones.
All examples uses the following libraries:
 - jquery.js: Used for multiple purposes, in general is used to ease the access and interaction with the dom elements.
 - json2.js: Used to parse json files and decode them into javascript objects.
 - underscore.js: Used for multiple purposes such as binding of events, utility functions (foreach, isNull, isEmpty, etc).
 - backbone.js: Used for the MVC implementation.
 
 Each example contains a readme file that explains what is being done on the example.
